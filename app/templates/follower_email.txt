Dear {{ user.nickname }},

{{ follower.nickname }} is now a follower. Click on the following link to 
visit {{ follower.nickname }}'s profile page:

; argument `_external`: By default, the `url_for('index')` will be `/index`
; while in this case we want http://localhost:5000/index. In an email there
; is no domain context, so we have to force fully quelified URLs that include
; the domain, and the `_external` argument is just for that.
{{ url_for('user', nickanme=follower.nickname, _external=True) }}
